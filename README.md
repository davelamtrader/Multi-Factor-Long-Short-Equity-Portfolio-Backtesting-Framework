# Multi-Factor-Long-Short-Equity-Portfolio-Backtesting-Framework
This repo provides a solid foundation for a production-grade multi-factor long-short equity portfolio backtesting system. 

## Architecture Overview
The backtesting engine consists of several key components:

**Core Components:**
-   Data Manager: Handles price, fundamental, and alternative data
-   Factor Calculator: Computes factor exposures and scores
-   Portfolio Constructor: Builds portfolios based on factor signals
-   Risk Manager: Manages position sizing and risk constraints
-   Transaction Cost Model: Estimates trading costs realistically
-   Performance Analytics: Calculates returns, risk metrics, and attribution
-   Backtester Engine: Orchestrates the entire process


## Key Production Considerations

**Data Quality and Timing:**
-   Point-in-time data is crucial to avoid look-ahead bias
-   Handle corporate actions, delistings, and data gaps properly
-   Implement data validation and outlier detection

**Realistic Trading Scenarios:**
-   Model transaction costs including market impact, spreads, and commissions
-   Account for liquidity constraints and trading capacity
-   Handle partial fills and execution delays

**Risk Management:**
-   Implement comprehensive risk models and constraints
-   Monitor factor exposures and concentration risk
-   Include stress testing and scenario analysis

**Performance Attribution:**
-   Track factor contributions to returns
-   Analyze transaction cost impact
-   Monitor implementation shortfall vs. theoretical returns
